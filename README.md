# Planetary Sciences: Remote Sensing Tutorial

This repo contains tutorials from Fabian Fassnacht to get you started with downloading Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery. You can either work through them by opening them in your browser or by cloning the repo to your local computer (see below).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Remote-Sensing-at-FU-Berlin/planetary-sciences-tutorials.git

# How to use
## Headings
The number of hashtags before the headings indicate the level. For example, "Headings" is a level 2 heading, "Unordered List" is a level 3 heading.

## Formatting

*Cursive*

**Bold**

## List

### Unordered list

- Object 1
- Object 2

### Ordered list

1. object 1
2. object 2

## Code block
This is an R code chunk. You can also execute this in R-Studio. Just click the arrow in the upper right corner.

```r
y= 2+2
y
```
Each code chunk will appear later in the HTML as a separate paragraph.

```r
setwd("C:\\Path\\to\\your\\directory")
```

## Quotes
This is what a quote looks like, the second quote also has the font size set smaller. 

> This is a quote in normal font size. 

## Links

This is a [link](https://remote-sensing-at-fu-berlin.github.io/arcgispro-tutorials/bildinterpretation_mit_google_earth/). The part in the square brackets is the display name and the part in the round brackets is the https link.

## Images
Here I include an image that is in the "assets" folder. If I save the images in another folder, you have to specify the relative path accordingly.

![](./assets/image.jpg)

## Formulas
Formulas can either be inserted as images or you can use the latex formatting:

Equation in a line $A = \pi*r^{2}$   

Equation in a separate line: 

$$E = mc^{2}$$
